# Cyber Security Timer

Enter 6 correct passwords, one-by-one, to stop your data from being deleted. You'll have 5 hours to complete the task. If you enter an incorrect password or enter a correct password more than once, you'll have 15 minutes deducted from your time. If you enter all 6 correct passwords, the timer will stop.
